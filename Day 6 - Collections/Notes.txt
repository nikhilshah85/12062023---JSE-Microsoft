			Data Structure / Collections


When you want to store multiple values in a single variable we use collections

1. Array 
2. ArrayList
3. List
4. Hashtable
5. Dictionary 

---------------------
Array - Drawbacks

	need to know and have a fix size for storage
	int[] numbers = new int[20];

	this will take place for 20 int - 20*4 byyes = 80 bytes

  --if user do not wish to enter 20 numbers, it is not a problem but space is going waste in memory
  --if user wish to add more numbers (30) - we do not have space for the same :(
  --user always has to enter number  in int format - cannot enter - Ten 	


Solution : Array list

------------------------------------------------

Array list : Drawbacks

	All the values are stored as an Object - which needs converstion while takeing the value
		out from the variable

	it uses a mechanism - Boxing and unboxing
		boxing - convert from value type to reference type
		unboxing - converty from ref type to value

	which is a hardwork and stress for the processor

	not good for performance of an application 

Solution : List

-------------------------------------------------------
List : this does not need a size, but data type has to be followed

	Drawback : it can have duplicate values, everyvalue is not unique


-----------------------------------
HashTable : this is for key and a value pair
		Key needs to be unique
		Value can be anything

	Drawback : same like Arraylist - needs boxing and unboxing

Solution: Dictionary
-----------------------------
Dictionary : this is for key and a value pair
		Key needs to be unique
		Value can be anything
